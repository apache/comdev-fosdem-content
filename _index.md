    <p> Whilst 2020 has been quite a challenging year world-wide, the all-volunteer Apache community has demonstrated commendable strength, resilience, and commitment to our tenet of "Community Over Code":
    <ul>
    <li>238 Apache Projects, sub-projects, incubating podlings, and their communities produced nearly <strong>3,500 releases</strong> across dozens of categories.
    </li>
    <li>We produced the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU2OcwpQkYCwJzJAv9ljupQu-5aBJ61NH" target="_blank">"Trillions and Trillions Served" documentary</a> that showcases how <a href="http://apache.org/theapacheway/" target="_blank">The Apache Way</a> skyrocketed the ASF from overseeing a single project two decades ago to 350+ projects that produce $22B+ worth of software today.</li>
    <li>Apache events moved online, and attracted our most diverse and greatest number of participants. ApacheCon@Home drew nearly 5,750 participants from more than 150 countries, who enjoyed 300+ sessions across 27 tracks. A staggering 1.5M+ viewers tuned in to the Apache Roadshow/China over its 2-day online event.</li>
